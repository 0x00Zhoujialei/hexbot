# RandomDraw

## About

RandomDraw is a [Hexbot](https://https://github.com/noops-challenge/hexbot) submission that uses colors to generate parameters for drawing a semi-random pattern.

The relatively simple python program utilizes turtle graphics to illustrate a range of different designs that vary depending upon its input from Hexbot.
